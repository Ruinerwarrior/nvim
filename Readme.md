# Installation
1. Make sure you have [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) installed. This configuration was tested with Neovim 0.9+ but it may work on other versions as well.
2. Clone this repository into your neovim directory.
3. Start neovim in your terminal of choice

# Currently included packages
This configuration contains some packages to improve my workflow, it might not work for you, as far as I know this is a 
pretty minimal config so you might want to adjust to any personal needs.
